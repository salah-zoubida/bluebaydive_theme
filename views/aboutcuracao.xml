    <h3 style="text-align:justify">Curacao, a little piece of paradise in the lower Caribbean</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Together with Aruba and Bonaire, also called the ABC islands and  part of  the Netherlands Antilles, Curacao is  located in the Southern Caribbean. Curaçao is a good example of a multicultural society. Many cultures live together like the  African’s, Latin Americans, Northern Americans, Indians, and Europeans. This also reflects the kitchen, with  cuisines from around the world. Local dishes like "Stoba" (local stew), "Keshi Yena" (stuffed cheese), Iguana soup and the Red Snapper are must try on the island! The native language is called Papiamentu, but most of the locals also speak English, Dutch, and Spanish.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify">Weather &amp;amp; Water Conditions</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">The climate on Curacao is very favorable so it is possible to dive throughout the whole year. The temperature above water varies between 26 to 34 degrees Celsius and the temperature below the water varies between 25 to 30 degrees Celsius. Curacao is wrapped around the top of South America protecting it from the strong winds of tropical storms and hurricanes. This allows Curacao to have calm seas, good visibility and nice sunny days. Besides a great location and wonderful weather, it is paired with an eye-pleasing underwater world.

<h3 style="text-align:justify">The Island &amp;amp; City</h3>

<p>Curaçao, a Dutch Caribbean island, is known for its beaches tucked into coves and its expansive coral reefs rich with marine life. The capital, Willemstad, has pastel-colored colonial architecture, floating Queen Emma Bridge and the sand-floored, 17th-century Mikvé Israel-Emanuel Synagogue.  </p>

<p>The Handelskade, listed on the Unesco World Heritage List,  is a quay located in downtown Willemstad on the Punda side. Restaurants, bars, shops, and companies are located in the colorful buildings. The Pontjesbrug, also known as the Queen Emma Bridge,  is connecting  both sides of downtown Willemstad,  Punda to Otrobanda.  It is the only floating swing bridge in the world, which swings  open to give entrance for various military ships to come into port. During your stay at Curaçao, you shouldn’t miss this place.  </p>

<p>With beautiful beaches, unique architecture, various bar &amp;amp; restaurants, and world-class scuba diving, the island is a great place for divers and non-divers.</p>

<h3>Blue Bay Beach</h3>

<p>Blue Bay Beach (Blauwbaai) is  one of Curaçao's most beloved beaches. Just offshore is an impressive coral reef, lauded by scuba divers and snorkelers for its easy accessibility. Swim five minutes from the beach and you will start to see multicolored coral and tropical fish.</p>
