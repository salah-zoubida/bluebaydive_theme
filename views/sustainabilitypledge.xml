    <h3>Sustainability Pledge of Blue Bay Dive, Curacao</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">At Blue Bay Dive &amp;amp; Watersports, we pledge to continue the monthly Dive Against Debris cleanups at our adopted house reefs. We can make a difference in Curacao by utilizing our network of divers to inspire locals, tourists and other dive professionals to take action and spread awareness!</p>

<h3>Sustainability Pledge of Dive Division, Curacao</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.mission2020.org/" target="_blank">Dive Division</a> has a truly sustainable mindset and pledges to advocate environmental safe practices. All dive shops involved adopted a dive site and do a monthly Dive Against Debris cleanup. Also, we only sell and promote reef-friendly sunscreen and avoid single-use plastic. We pledge to continue with these good habits.</p>

<h3>About <a href="https://www.mission2020.org/" target="_blank">Mission 2020</a></h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">We love the ocean, and we want to do what we can to protect it for the future. Divers see the damage that human activity is having on the ocean environment more clearly than anyone else and we have realized that it is time for us to make changes to prevent further damage.<br/>
Mission 2020 is a collection of pledges from organizations within the diving community to change their business practices in order to help protect and preserve our oceans for the future. With a primary focus on single-use plastic, the project sets ambitious short term targets of changes to be made before World Oceans Day 2020.<br/>
Mission 2020 was originally conceived by the fourth element as a statement of its intentions to eliminate the use of single-use plastic in the packaging of all its products by 2020 and to continue to develop new products (and re-develop its existing products) using recycled materials wherever possible. By inviting other organizations within the dive community to join Mission 2020 and encouraging them to make their own commitments, the fourth element hopes to make this a commitment of the global dive community to protect the very thing which we enjoy â€“ the ocean.</p>
