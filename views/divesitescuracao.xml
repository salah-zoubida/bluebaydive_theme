    <h3>Discover Curacao's best shore boat dive sites!</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Curaçao is one of the ultimate shore diving islands in the Caribbean. It is a volcanic island which forms a "pillar" in the Southern Caribbean Sea, allowing the divers to access the reef right from the beach. The house reef of Blue Bay “The Wall” and “The Garden”, both easily accessible from shore are known as one of the best shore dives on Curacao. With a shallow bay, the house reef is ideal to start your scuba diving or have training dives.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Next, to shore diving, Blue Bay Dive &amp;amp; Watersports also offers boat diving. This way we can go to the more secluded dive sites on the island. Find out more about our favorite dive sites below.</p>

<h3>Blue Bay The Wall</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Wall is renowned on the island for its one-of-a-kind diving experience. Located on the at Blue Bay Beach, The Wall is a continuance of the cliff, rising from the sea.

Untouched by the effects of human habitats, The Wall is a true coral and other reef life gem. This dive site is loved by photographers due to her high variety of structures and macro life. Seahorses, frogfishes, juvenile fish and other small creatures are often found. <a href="https://www.diveshopcuracao.com/en/guideddives">- <i>Shore Dive from Blue Bay Beach -</i></a></p>
